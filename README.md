🧭 Exploratory Data Analysis Summary

Dataset Overview :

The dataset records daily order counts over a two-year period (2016–2018).
Each row represents the total number of customer orders placed on a specific date.

Key Insights :

# Order Volume Growth:

Early activity (2016) shows very few daily orders, suggesting the company was in its early operational or pilot phase.

From early 2017 onwards, there is a consistent upward trend in daily orders — indicating successful customer acquisition and platform adoption.

# Peak Spike (Late 2017):

A massive spike occurred around November 2017, with daily orders surpassing 1,200.

This likely aligns with a seasonal or promotional campaign such as a festive sale (e.g., Diwali, Black Friday, or end-of-year discounts).

# Stabilization and Decline:

After the peak, daily orders stabilized around 150–300 orders per day throughout 2018.

A sudden decline is visible around August–October 2018, possibly due to:

Market saturation or competition.

Reduced marketing efforts.

Operational or platform issues.

Seasonality and Consumer Behavior:

The data suggests potential seasonal buying behavior, especially towards the end of the year.

This could help in designing time-based campaigns for better ROI.

# Recommendations for the Company :

# Leverage Seasonal Trends:

Plan and invest in marketing campaigns during historically high-demand months (e.g., November–December).

Offer time-limited discounts or exclusive deals during this period.

# Investigate the Decline (Post-2018):

Conduct root-cause analysis on the declining order trend — review marketing budgets, user retention rates, and competitor moves.

Re-engage inactive customers through targeted email campaigns and personalized offers.

# Retention & Loyalty Focus:

Introduce a customer loyalty program to maintain the active customer base.

Encourage repeat purchases through reward points, membership tiers, or referral benefits.

# Operational Improvements:

Monitor order fulfillment efficiency and user satisfaction to prevent drop-offs.

Use analytics to forecast demand and manage inventory proactively.

# Data-Driven Strategy:

Build predictive models to forecast future order volumes.

Use insights from daily trends to optimize marketing spend and improve customer experience.
